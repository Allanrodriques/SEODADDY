In this project, we present a approach that can detect and filter the  spam messages using machine learning classification algorithms.

The aim of this project is to detect whether the received SMS is a ham or spam.With digital currency many people are prone to smishing attack in which the fraudster  sends fake SMS messages pretending to be a reputable company in order to get individuals to reveal their personal information, passwords or credit card details.

Our SMS Spam Detector checks the SMS entered across various datasets and gives a “Clear” message if the SMS is original and sent from a genuine organization and it will give a warning “Alert” message if the SMS is sent from a fraudster pretending to be a genuine organization

This will help our users to differentiate between spam and actual messages thus saving them from fraud.
